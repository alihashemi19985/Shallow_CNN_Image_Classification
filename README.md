The SCNNB network has only 4 layers with small size of convolution kernels, which requires
low time complexity and space complexity. In the experiments, we compare the SCNNB model with two variant models
and the classical SCNN model on the two benchmark image datasets. Experimental results show that compared to SCNN
model, the SCNNB model can quickly learn the features of the data and achieve the highest classifcation accuracy of
93.69% with 3.8 M time complexity on fashion-MNIST.
